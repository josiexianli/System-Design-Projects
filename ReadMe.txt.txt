MVC app has been created with two endpoints:

1. /createAccount is visible. http://localhost/account/jsp/account.jsp will go to the create account form 
and a response page will serve as a confirmation page once account has been created.

Note: need to create related tables first on server.

2. /returnItem is invisible. Can be hit directly at http://localhost/account/returnItem with the controller will process the request
